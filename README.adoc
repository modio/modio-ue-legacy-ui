Welcome to the mod.io Unreal Engine Legacy UE5 UI repository. This repository is intended for the use of developers who were using our previous UE5 UI implementation who wish to continue to do so, but update their mod.io core plugin to take advantage of new functionality.  

== Engine & Platform Compatibility

This plugin requires the core mod.io plugin to be installed alongside it. As it is a legacy implementation intended for existing consumers, there will be no further updates to the implementation or engine compatibility.
